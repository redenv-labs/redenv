# Redenv: A Zero-Knowledge Secret Management System

**A Developer-First, End-to-End Encrypted CLI for Secure and Dynamic Environment Variable Management, Optimized for the Serverless Era.**

---

## Abstract

In modern software development, managing environment variables and secrets (`.env` files) across different environments, teams, and platforms is a primary source of security vulnerabilities, operational friction, and development slowdowns. The rise of immutable infrastructure on serverless platforms (e.g., Vercel, Netlify) has introduced a new paradigm: the "rebuild to rotate" cycle, where simple configuration changes require a full application redeployment.

**Redenv** is a comprehensive solution designed to solve these problems. It is a CLI-first secret management system that centralizes environment variables in a Redis backend you control. It features a robust, zero-knowledge, end-to-end encrypted architecture, ensuring that your secrets are always protected. By decoupling configuration from deployment, Redenv allows development teams to manage secrets dynamically and securely, drastically improving workflow efficiency and security posture.

## Quick Start

Get up and running with Redenv in under 60 seconds.

### 1. Install the CLI
Install the Redenv CLI globally using your preferred package manager:

```bash
pnpm add -g @redenv/cli
```

### 2. Connect to Upstash
Connect your CLI to an Upstash Redis database. You can find your REST URL and Token in the Upstash Console.

```bash
redenv setup
```

### 3. Register your Project
Navigate to your project directory and initialize it with an encrypted vault.

```bash
redenv register my-awesome-app
```

*Note: You will be prompted to create a **Master Password**. This password is the only key to your secrets—never lose it.*

### 3.1 Install Dev Dependencies

```bash
bun add -D @redenv/core
```

### 4. Manage Secrets
Add your first encrypted secret and view it:

```bash
# Add a secret
redenv add API_KEY "super-secret-value"

# View the secret
redenv view API_KEY
```

### 5. Use in Your App (SDK)
Install the zero-knowledge client:

```bash
bun add @redenv/client
```

Access secrets at runtime (fully decrypted in memory):

```typescript
import { Redenv } from "@redenv/client";

const redenv = new Redenv({
  project: "my-awesome-app",
  tokenId: process.env.REDENV_TOKEN_ID,
  token: process.env.REDENV_TOKEN_KEY,
  upstash: { ... },
});

// Load secrets (stale-while-revalidate caching built-in)
const secrets = await redenv.load();
console.log(secrets.API_KEY); 
```

### 6. Visual Management (Optional Plugin)
For a rich, visual dashboard, install the Studio plugin. Redenv uses a plugin system, keeping the core lightweight while allowing you to add powerful features like this.

**Install:**
```bash
pnpm add -D @redenv/studio
```

**Configure:**
Add it to your `redenv.config.ts`:

```typescript
import { defineConfig } from "@redenv/core";
import { studioPlugin } from "@redenv/studio";

export default defineConfig({
  ...
  plugins: [studioPlugin],
});
```

**Launch:**
```bash
redenv studio
```
*This starts a local dashboard where you can drag-and-drop secrets, manage environments, and sync keys visually.*

## 1. The Research Problem: The State of Configuration Management

The management of application secrets has long been a challenge, but the evolution of development and deployment practices has created two distinct, significant problem areas.

#### 1.1 The Traditional Problem: The Chaos of `.env` Files

The de-facto standard for local development configuration, the `.env` file, is a known anti-pattern when used at scale.

- **Synchronization Drift:** As teams grow, keeping `.env` files synchronized between developers is a constant struggle. This often leads to "works on my machine" issues and hours of lost productivity.
- **Insecure Distribution:** The lack of a central source of truth forces teams into insecure practices, such as sharing secrets over Slack, email, or text messages, creating a massive security liability.

#### 1.2 The Modern Problem: The Inflexibility of Build-Time Secrets

Serverless and edge platforms have revolutionized deployment, but they have also cemented a new problem. By treating environment variables as immutable, build-time constants, they create a rigid and slow workflow for configuration changes.

- **The "Rebuild to Rotate" Cycle:** On these platforms, updating a secret (e.g., rotating a leaked API key) is a high-stakes, time-consuming process. A developer must manually change the variable in a web UI, trigger a new build, and wait for the entire deployment pipeline to complete. In an emergency, this delay is unacceptable.
- **Coupling of Concerns:** This paradigm tightly couples an application's _configuration_ with its _code_. A simple change to a logging level or a feature flag requires the same process as a major code change, creating operational bottlenecks.

## 2. The Redenv Solution: A New Architectural Thesis

Redenv is architected to solve these problems by re-imagining the relationship between an application and its configuration. It is built on four core principles:

1.  **Centralized & Synchronized:** A single source of truth for all secrets, stored in a Redis database you control.
2.  **Secure by Default (Zero-Knowledge):** A robust end-to-end encryption model ensures that the database is considered "untrusted." Your secrets are never stored in plaintext.
3.  **Complete Version History:** Every change to a secret is recorded in an immutable history, providing a full audit trail and enabling instant rollbacks.
4.  **Dynamic & Decoupled:** Redenv is designed to be used with a runtime client (`@redenv/client`), allowing applications to fetch their configuration on startup. This completely decouples secret rotation from the deployment cycle.
5.  **Developer-First Experience:** A powerful and intuitive CLI provides a complete suite of commands covering the entire secret management lifecycle, with UX-focused features like secure password caching.

## 3. System Design & Technology Choices

The effectiveness of Redenv stems from specific, deliberate technology and architectural choices.

#### 3.1 Technology: Built Exclusively for Upstash Redis

Redenv is built exclusively for **Upstash Redis**, a deliberate design choice that enables universal connectivity and unmatched performance.

- **Unmatched Speed:** Upstash provides extremely low-latency data access, which is critical for application startup times. When an application boots, it must load its secrets instantly; any delay increases cold start times and degrades user experience.
- **Serverless Model:** Upstash's serverless pricing and connection model is a perfect fit for CLI tools and serverless functions, which have intermittent, spiky traffic patterns.
- **HTTP-Based Client:** The `@upstash/redis` client operates over a standard HTTP/REST API. This is a crucial advantage, as it guarantees connectivity from any environment, including restrictive corporate networks, serverless functions, and edge workers where traditional TCP connections may be blocked or impractical.

#### 3.2 Security Architecture: A Zero-Knowledge Model

Redenv's security is its most critical component. It is architected to ensure that secrets are only ever held in plaintext on the user's machine or the application's runtime memory—never in the database.

The following diagram illustrates the decryption flow. The reverse process is used for encryption.

![Security Flow](security-flow.svg)

- **Per-Project Encryption:** Each project is an isolated security domain protected by a unique **Project Encryption Key (PEK)**.
- **Master Password:** The PEK is "wrapped" (encrypted) by a key derived from a user-provided **Master Password**. This Master Password is known only to the user and is never stored or transmitted.
- **Key Derivation:** We use `PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256` with `310,000` iterations, a strong, industry-standard Key Derivation Function recommended by OWASP, to protect against brute-force attacks on the Master Password. This is implemented via the universal Web Crypto API, ensuring compatibility across all modern JavaScript runtimes.
- **Authenticated Encryption:** All data, including all historical versions of secrets, is encrypted using `AES-256-GCM`, which provides both confidentiality and integrity.
- **Service Tokens:** For programmatic access, Redenv uses a secure token system. A token consists of a **Public ID** (a non-secret identifier) and a **Secret Key**. The Secret Key is used to decrypt the PEK for a specific project, allowing a server or CI/CD pipeline to securely fetch secrets without a password. This secret is displayed only once upon creation and must be stored securely by the user.

#### 3.3 Data Model in Redis

Redenv uses two primary key formats in Redis to organize data:

- **Metadata Key (`meta@<project-name>`):** A Redis Hash that stores essential metadata for a project. This includes the encrypted Project Encryption Key (PEK), the salt for the Master Password, the history limit setting, and the configuration for any Service Tokens.
- **Environment Key (`<environment-name>:<project-name>`):** A Redis Hash where each field represents a secret's key. The value for each field is a JSON string containing an array of versioned secrets, with the most recent secret at the first index.

This structure provides efficient, project-scoped data retrieval while keeping all secrets for a given environment under a single Redis key.

## 4. Features & Capabilities

Redenv provides a comprehensive suite of commands to manage secrets with confidence.

- **Core Commands:** `add`, `edit`, `view`, `list`, `remove`
- **Project Management:** `register`, `drop`, `switch`
- **Advanced Workflows:** `import`, `export`, `clone`, `diff`, `promote`
- **Auditing & History:** `history` (`view`, `limit`), `rollback`
- **Security & Safety:** `change-password`, `backup`, `restore`, `doctor`, `logout`
- **Application Access:** `token` (`create`, `list`, `revoke`)

## 5. The `@redenv/client`: Dynamic Runtime Secrets

The Redenv ecosystem is completed by the **`@redenv/client`**, a lightweight library for any server-side JavaScript or TypeScript application. It allows applications to fetch, decrypt, and consume secrets securely and dynamically at runtime, fully realizing the vision of decoupling configuration from deployment.

- **High-Performance Caching:** The client features a built-in, in-memory cache with `stale-while-revalidate` logic. This ensures that secrets are served to your application instantly, eliminating latency and providing resilience against network issues, while still keeping secrets up-to-date in the background.
- **Zero-Knowledge, Too:** All cryptographic operations happen on the client side, maintaining the same zero-knowledge security guarantee as the CLI. The application uses a Service Token to decrypt the Project Encryption Key locally.
- **Seamless Integration:** It can automatically populate `process.env` or provide a client object (`get`, `getAll`) for programmatic access, fitting easily into existing application logic.

By using the `@redenv/client`, you can rotate an API key or change a feature flag and have it reflect in your running applications in seconds, without requiring a new build or deployment.

## 6. The `@redenv/studio`: Visual Management

For those who prefer a visual interface over the command line, Redenv offers **`@redenv/studio`** ([NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@redenv/studio) | [GitHub](https://github.com/redenv-labs/redenv-studio-plugin)). This plugin launches a modern, local web dashboard that provides a rich graphical interface for managing your secrets.

- **Visual Dashboard:** View and edit secrets across all environments in a table view.
- **Environment Management:** Create, delete, and manage environments with ease.
- **Access Control:** Generate and manage Service Tokens for your applications and CI/CD pipelines visually.
- **Secure:** Runs locally on your machine, maintaining the same zero-knowledge security model as the CLI.

To use it, simply install the plugin and run:

```bash
redenv studio
```
