# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- **Atomic Secret Updates:** Refactored `writeSecret` to use a Lua script for atomic "read-modify-write" operations in Redis. This prevents race conditions and data loss during concurrent secret updates.
- **Cluster-Safe Architecture:** Optimized the update flow to be Redis Cluster compatible by separating metadata retrieval from the atomic write operation, avoiding CROSSSLOT errors.

## [1.1.1] - 2026-01-25

### Changed

- **Improved Secret Expansion:** Refactored `expandSecrets` logic to robustly handle complex backslash escaping (even/odd backslash patterns) and recursive resolution.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-01-25

### Added

- **Secret Expansion:** Added `expandSecrets` utility to recursively resolve `${VAR_NAME}` references within secret values, including cycle detection and escaping support.

## [1.0.5] - 2025-12-08

### Added

- **Plugin API Enhancements:**
  - enhanced `getEphemeralToken` to return `expiresAt` date.

## [1.0.4] - 2025-12-07

### Added

- **Plugin API Enhancements:**
  - `PluginContext` now includes `redisUrl` and `redisToken` for direct access to Redis connection details.
  - `PluginContext` now provides `getEphemeralToken()` to allow plugins to securely obtain temporary, session-scoped Service Tokens.

## [1.0.3] - 2025-12-06

### Added

- Added `createPlugin` function for plugin creation.

## [1.0.2] - 2025-12-06

### Added

- Added Helper functions for configuration loading and plugin validation.

## [1.0.1] - 2025-11-26

### Changed

- enhanced `randomBytes` function to support custom encodings.

## [1.0.0] - 2025-11-25

### Added

- **Initial Release:** First public version of `@redenv/core`.
- **Cryptographic Primitives:**
  - `encrypt`: Encrypts data using `AES-256-GCM`.
  - `decrypt`: Decrypts data using `AES-256-GCM`.
  - `deriveKey`: Derives an encryption key from a password using `scrypt`.
  - `generateSalt`: Generates a cryptographically secure random salt.
- **Secret Writing Utility:**
  - `writeSecret`: Provides a shared utility for performing the "read-modify-write" cycle for updating a secret's version history in Redis.
