# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [1.5.0] - 2026-01-25

### Added

- **Secret Referencing:** Full support for `${VAR_NAME}` syntax in secret values. References are recursively resolved in `list`, `view`, and `export` commands.
- **Improved UI:** Introduced a clean, tree-style output format for `list` and `view` commands to better display multi-line values and expansion details.
- **Reference Validation:** The `add` and `edit` commands now interactively validate referenced keys and warn if they don't exist.
- **Command Arguments:** The `add` and `edit` commands now accept an optional `[value]` argument for quicker, non-interactive secret updates.
- **Smart Edit:** The `edit` command now pre-populates the prompt with the current secret value for easier modification.
- **Raw Export:** Added `--raw` flag to `redenv export` to skip variable expansion.

## [1.4.2] - 2026-01-03

### Added

- **Token Auditing:** The `token create` command now captures and stores the creator's identity (email or system username) in the `createdBy` field for better auditing.

## [1.4.1] - 2025-12-08

### Added

- **Plugin API Enhancements:** Enhanced `getEphemeralToken` to return `expiresAt` date.

## [1.4.0] - 2025-12-07

### Added

- **Plugin Context Enhancements:** The plugin context (`PluginContext`) now provides `redisUrl` and `redisToken` for direct access to the configured Upstash Redis credentials.
- **Ephemeral Token Support:** Introduced `getEphemeralToken()` in the `PluginContext`, allowing plugins to securely obtain temporary, session-scoped Service Tokens for accessing project secrets. These tokens are automatically cleaned up on CLI exit.

## [1.3.0] - 2025-12-06

### Added

- **Plugin Architecture:** Introduced a robust plugin system allowing users to extend CLI functionality. Plugins can now be defined in `redenv.config.js` or `redenv.config.ts` and are dynamically loaded at runtime.
- **Enhanced Configuration:** Added support for JavaScript/TypeScript configuration files (`.js`, `.ts`, `.cjs`, `.mjs`), enabling dynamic configuration and plugin integration.

### Changed

- **Configuration Strategy:** Shifted the primary configuration format from static JSON to dynamic JavaScript/TypeScript files. While `redenv.config.json` remains supported for backward compatibility, new projects are encouraged to use the script-based formats for greater flexibility.

## [1.2.0] - 2025-11-29

### Added

- **`sync` Command:** Introduced a new `redenv sync` command to interactively synchronize variables between any two environments. This powerful command allows for adding, updating, and removing keys to ensure two environments are perfectly aligned.

### Changed

- **Simplified Configuration:** The `productionEnvironment` field in `redenv.config.json` has been deprecated and removed. Commands like `sync` now prompt for a destination environment directly, making the workflow more flexible and explicit.

### Removed

- **`promote` Command:** The `promote` command has been removed and replaced by the more powerful and intuitive `sync` command.

## [1.1.4] - 2025-11-27

### Added

- **Interactive Shell:** Introduced a new `redenv shell` command that launches a dedicated interactive REPL for a project environment. This provides a persistent session for running multiple commands without repeatedly entering the Master Password. The shell supports context switching, command history, and access to most Redenv commands.

### Changed

- **Major Internal Refactoring for Shell Compatibility:** Refactored the internal command structure to support the new interactive shell. Commands now operate in a "shell-aware" mode, allowing for seamless context switching (e.g., `switch env`) and more robust error handling within a REPL environment.

## [1.1.3] - 2025-11-26

### Changed

- Removed the `value` argument from the `add` commands. Now it prompts for the value interactively for multiline values.

## [1.1.2] - 2025-11-26

### Changed

- `token` command now uses `randomBytes` function's base64 encoding to generate random strings.

## [1.1.1] - 2025-11-25

### Changed

- Moved the crypto logic to the `@redenv/core` package.

## [1.1.0] - 2025-11-18

### Changed

- **BREAKING:** The core crypto engine has been completely refactored from the Node.js-specific `crypto` module (using `scrypt`) to the universal **Web Crypto API** (using `PBKDF2`). This makes the entire system compatible with all modern JavaScript runtimes, including serverless and edge environments.
- All commands have been updated to work with the new asynchronous cryptographic functions.

### Fixed

- Resolved a critical TypeScript type conflict between Node.js's `webcrypto.CryptoKey` and the global `CryptoKey` type, ensuring type safety across the project.

## [1.0.0] - 2025-11-18

This is the initial public release of the Redenv CLI, a secure, feature-rich, and user-friendly tool for modern secret management.

### Added

- **End-to-End Encryption:** Implemented a full zero-knowledge, end-to-end encryption model using a per-project Master Password system. All secrets are encrypted/decrypted locally and are never stored in plaintext.
- **Per-Secret Version History:** Every change to a secret is now stored in a versioned history, providing a complete audit trail with user and timestamp information.
- **Core Commands:** Full suite of commands for secret management: `add`, `edit`, `view`, `list`, `remove`.
- **Project Management Commands:** Commands for project lifecycle: `register`, `drop`, `switch`.
- **Advanced Workflow Commands:** Powerful commands for team and CI/CD workflows: `import`, `export`, `clone`, `diff`, `promote`.
- **History & Rollback Commands:**
  - `history view [key]`: View the complete version history of a secret.
  - `history limit [value]`: Configure the number of versions to keep per secret.
  - `rollback <key>`: Instantly revert a secret to a previous version.
- **Security & Safety Commands:**
  - `change-password`: Securely rotate a project's Master Password.
  - `backup` & `restore`: Create and restore fully encrypted backups of your projects.
  - `doctor`: A diagnostic tool to check your configuration and connectivity.
- **Application Access Management:**
  - `token` command suite (`create`, `list`, `revoke`) to manage secure, Service Tokens for applications.
- **Secure Password Caching:** Implemented an optional, secure caching of unlocked project keys into the native OS keychain (`keytar`) for a seamless, password-less workflow during a session.
- **Unit Testing Foundation:** Introduced `vitest` and created a foundational test suite for the critical crypto and utility modules.
- **Comprehensive Documentation:** Created a detailed architectural `README.md` for the project root and a practical quick-start guide for the CLI package.

### Changed

- **Improved `register` Command:** The `register` command is now idempotent and intelligently checks for remotely existing projects to prevent accidental overwrites, allowing it to also function as a "connect to existing project" command.
- **Data Model:** Migrated secret storage from a simple key-value model to a versioned JSON structure to support auditing and rollbacks.
- **Refactored Write Logic:** Centralized all secret-writing logic into a single `writeSecret` utility to improve maintainability and consistency.

### Fixed

- **UI Stability:** Resolved multiple bugs where `ora` spinner animations would conflict with `inquirer` prompts, causing display loops and crashes.
- **Cryptography:** Fixed a critical bug in the `decrypt` function's error handling that was masking specific error types.
- **System Compatibility:** Tuned `scrypt` memory parameters to ensure compatibility with different environments, including the `bun` runtime.
- **Security:** Fixed a security flaw where the `change-password` command could incorrectly use a cached keychain entry instead of requiring re-authentication.
- **Data Parsing:** Corrected a recurring `JSON.parse` error in multiple commands by properly handling the auto-parsing behavior of the `@upstash/redis` client.
